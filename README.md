# Credit_Risk_Analysis

*Utilized several machine learning models to predict credit risk using Python's imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries*

## Supervised Machine Learning Overview
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.  We then will evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
